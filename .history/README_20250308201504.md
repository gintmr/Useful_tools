## 1. Introduction

This repository contains a set of tools for converting datasets to COCO format. The tools are written in Python and can be used to convert datasets in various formats to COCO format, which is a widely used format for object detection and segmentation tasks.

## 2. Tools

The following tools are included in this repository:


- `merge_multi_datasets.py`: 
  
    > This script merges multiple datasets into a single dataset in COCO format. It takes as input a list of dataset directories and merges them into a single dataset, with each dataset having its own category and instance IDs.

    Usage:将待合并的多个数据集，按照json文件夹与images文件夹的形式分别添加在列表中，然后运行脚本即可

    本脚本在合并时，会同时生成后缀为_categories.json的文件，用于存储合并后数据集的类别信息（本脚本不包含合并测试与验证集的关系，因此保留一个categories副本，便于修改）
